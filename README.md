## HL7 Notes and Tips - Unoffical notes/tips from various developers based on their experinces in the field
- Read the damn HL7 messaging spec, you'll learn a lot. - [HL7 General](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/index.cfm?ref=nav), [HL7v2](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_section.cfm?section=13) and [HL7v3](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_section.cfm?section=14)
- Expect that the people you're integrating with haven't read the HL7 spec.
- Follow the standard! While you can make an Accession Number longer than 16 characters it will cause issues!
